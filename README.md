# exercise.timeout
## Problem statement
The Time Out team loves to socialise, some of us are also really fussy! In order to spend less time deciding where to go weâ€™d like a program that decides for us. All members of the team will want both food and drink so if a member of staff cannot eat anything, or no drinks are served that they like, the team will not visit the venue.
